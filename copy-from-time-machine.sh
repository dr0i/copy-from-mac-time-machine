# Copy data from a Time Machine volume mounted on a Linux box.
#
# Usage: copy-from-time-machine.sh <source> <target>
#
# source: the source directory inside a time machine backup
# target: the target directory in which to copy the reconstructed
#         directory trees. Created if it does not exists.
#
# Details:
#
# Time machine implements directory hard links by creating an
# empty file in place of the directory and storing in its
# "number of hard links" metadata attribute a pointer to a
# real directory in "/.HFS Private directory data^M" named
# "dir_$number".
#
# This script reconstructs a plain directory tree from this
# really ugly apple hack. Tested on a 650GB backup from OSX
# 10.6 mounted on a Linux 3.2.0-38 Ubuntu box. YMMV.
